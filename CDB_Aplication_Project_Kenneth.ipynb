    "This is a compilation of many different python programs I have created. I combined them through a basic text interface system that connects to other functions that were originally their own programs but were slightly modified to fit into the text interface sytem. I enjoy the logical aspect of coding, which is why I have spent the time I have learning how. This is the culmination of several years of learning python, which forms much of my coding experience, making this program, at least for me,  a symbolic representation of the knowledge I have gained. Here is a list of the programs I have integrated and when I made them in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Guessing Game (accessed through typing \"guessing\"): This was a short project created midway through an extracurricular fifth grade coding class. In terms of input and interface, it is comparatively simple, but it utilizes the most complex graphics I learned in the form of basic turtle graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boggle (accessed through typing \"boggle\"): This was the final project in the aformentioned coding class, and used all the non-graphical programming I learned during the class. It was a 2-week project, during which I worked on and off, and was by far the most complex project I had programmed at the time\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastermind (accessed through typing \"mastermind\"): This was a program I made specifically for this project. My python programming was a little rusty, so I created this to remind myself of all that I had forgotten. It was created entirely during about 2.5 hours of free time in one day, and is similar to boggle, just slightly simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA Encryption (accessed through typing \"RSA\"): This was originally a project made for fifth grade math class. However, when looking over it for addition to my submission, I realized that I did not understand why it worked and blindly followed a simple guide to create it. I spent some time trying to understand it (with a little help from my dad) and heavily improved the program in the process. Now, I understand most of the math behind it, but I still hope to understand it better in the future."

It is based off of the property of multiplying two primes as a one-way opperation, or one that is easy to do but difficult to reverse. It utilizes this by creating a multiplicative inverse of a number in modulo x*y where x and y are both primes using the afformentioned x and y. This makes it possible to convert one number in mod x*y to another in mod x*y using a random number (the public code), and converting it back with its multiplicative inverse (the private code.)\")\n",
